ReactJS 

is a javascript library that simplifies creation of UI elements. 
It comes with a way easier handling of the DOM by removing the need to grab single elements and gives you the opportunity to change child nodes without re-rendering the whole DOM.
It offers a way to compartmentalize your code and reuse prewritten components again and again reducing devs workload. 
Also it allows for client-side rendering and thus saves ressources on hosts side.

All of this combined makes for easier development in larger projects and a lot less dev hours over the long run.
