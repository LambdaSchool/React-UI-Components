## In partners, write a paragraph about what ReactJS is and what problems that it tries to solve. Submit that paragraph to your Project Manager via Slack.

ReactJS is:
* Javascript UI library
* Simplifies DOM Manipulation
* Give you a way to handle data/states
* Makes DOM Manipulation more efficient through the ability to change DOM nodes without rerendering the whole DOM.
* Gives you a way to compartmentalize your code so you can reuse pre-written components.

ReactJS is a Javascript UI library. It's main aim is to ease DOM Manipulation, for both the developer and the browser. It eases DOM manipulation for the developer because we can use intuitive syntax like JSX to construct what we'd like the DOM to look like. React would then take this idea and manipulate the actual DOM to match it. It eases DOM manipulation for the browser because when React makes those changes to the DOM, it doesn't reload the entire DOM, but instead makes only the minimum changes necessary to have the actual DOM match the developer's idea of it. 

ReactJS also encourages more efficient code through the idea of components. By having components as a major motif of React, developers can write reusable and extensible blocks of code which they can use over and over again, in both the project they're working on and in other projects.
