React is an JS library that allows you to write code in a pattern in which only the UI interfaces are updated. In short React only changes the elements that needs to be updated and not the whole tree. By only changing the state of the element this promotes scability(sp), and its easy to learn because it is written in JS which. React is the V of the MVC architecture. React is also known as the Virtual DOM because of the state of the structure of the React DOM tree is stored and if there is any updates to be made it is able to do that because of "diffing", which improves performance.
