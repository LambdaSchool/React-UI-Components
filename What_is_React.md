# What is React
* React is a JS Libreary that allow us to create interactive UI. It has a focus on Browser optimization, abstracting the 'flow' and 'render' steps through ReactDOM which is in charge of this browser optimization.
* React abstraction gives us a methodology to slice and dice our code into small piaces.
These small pieces are like 'Lego' blocks, then is just a matter of creativity to build whatever with this Lego-blocks.
