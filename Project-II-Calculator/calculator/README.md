# Calculator

### Operators: {+, −, ×, ÷}

On click, grab value by class, push into array, evaluate on = (JS follows order of operations?)
> ({4,+,4,4})
> =
> return 48
{"+" = +, "−" = -, "×" = *. "÷" = /, "=" = =}

### Operands: real numbers, no symbols, no decimal button in guide, crappy IEEE 754-1985 based math
