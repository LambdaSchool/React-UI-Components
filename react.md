React is a JavaScript library (an already-made collection of functions) which developers can use as a resource in order to create applications.  The need that React addresses is the need to not overload the DOM.  React uses a virtual DOM that does most of the work as far as the maintenance of things that need to be changed on a website, which makes it easier for developers to write programs because they don't have to hard-code the changes to the DOM that occur through each state change of their program.  React is awesome in that you only have to target one element on the DOM to affix your program to and React will handle the rest.  It makes it much easier to write dynamic code.
